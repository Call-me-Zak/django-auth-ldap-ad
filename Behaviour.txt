Behaviour :

-- user account exists on Active Directory server
> User authenticated, no password stored
> User profile created in django-admin interface (no password stored)

-- user account deleted
> User no longer authenticated
> User profile remains stored on django-admin interface
> User profile can be found under user_auth table in django db
> If you re-create the same account on AD user is authenticated again (no duplicates)

!!! redundancy to avoid !!!
--staff account with user creation privileges sets a password for a user profile 
> user can log in with 2 passwords (AD password and password set by staff account)
> if AD account is removed, user can log in with password set by staff account
> Password is stored in django db

**Fix
> open django-admin interface and select user profile then disable password authentication (this enables SSO or LDAP authentication)
> password is no longer stored but old hash remains (manually delete it from user_auth table)
> user can only login with AD credentials (fixed)
